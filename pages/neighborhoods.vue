              It's very disheartening and very degrading. It's very demeaning to feel like you try to do the right thing—you go to school, work hard and better yourself—and you're treated the same as a criminal. I should feel comfortable enough going to neighborhoods rather than being fearful of being subjected to disrespectful and unlawful activities by a police officer.
