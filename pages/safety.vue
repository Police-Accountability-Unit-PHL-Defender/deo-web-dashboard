              I am humbled by every person who told my office of the humiliation and trauma experienced in some of these traffic stops. To many people who look like me, a traffic stop is a rite of passage â€“ we pick out cars, we determine routes, we plan our social interactions around the fact that it is likely that we will be pulled over by police.
