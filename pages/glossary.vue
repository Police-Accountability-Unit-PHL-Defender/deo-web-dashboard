          <dt>Contraband</dt>
          <dd>Any item that police consider to be evidence of a crime, including drugs and some weapons.</dd>
          <dt>Contraband Hit Rate</dt>
          <dd>How often police find any amount of contraband on drivers, on any passengers, and/or in the vehicle itself, relative to the number of drivers, passengers, and/or vehicles intruded upon by police.</dd>
          <dt>Defender</dt>
          <dd>The Defender Association of Philadelphia</dd>
          <dt>Disparity</dt>
          <dd>A difference in outcomes or treatment, particularly one that is considered unfair. </dd>
          <dt>District</dt>
          <dd>Philadelphia Police District, a numbered geographical division in the city to which police personnel are assigned. There are currently 21 police districts. </dd>
          <dt>Division</dt>
          <dd>Philadelphia Police Detective Division, a broad geographical division of the city to which detectives are assigned. There are six Detective Divisions: East, Southwest, South, Northwest, Northeast, and Central. </dd>
          <dt>Frisk</dt>
          <dd>An open-handed pat down of the outer layer of a person’s clothing or a physical inspection of the passenger compartment in a vehicle and any unlocked containers within reach of a driver or passenger. Police may only conduct a frisk if they have reasonable suspicion that the person committed a crime and can articulate specific facts that make them believe a person is armed and dangerous. If during the frisk the officer feels an object or material that is immediately apparent to them as contraband, they may conduct a search. If that search reveals contraband, the officer can confiscate it and arrest the person. In this dashboard, any frisk of a driver, passenger, and/or vehicle during one traffic stop is calculated as a single frisk.</dd>
          <dt>Frisk Rate</dt>
          <dd>How often police frisk drivers, any passengers, and/or the vehicle itself, relative to the number of vehicle stops by police. </dd>

          <dt>Intrusion</dt>
          <dd>A frisk and/or search by police during traffic stops. The term “intrusion” encapsulates a frisk, a search, or both. After the 2020 PA Supreme Court decision in Commonwealth v. Keith Alexander, police now cannot search a vehicle without a warrant in most situations and, as a result, PPD practice shifted towards frisking. The term “intrusion” captures both police practices. In this dashboard, any frisk and/or search of a driver, passenger, and/or vehicle during one traffic stop is calculated as a single intrusion.</dd>
          <dt>Intrusion Rate</dt>
          <dd>How often police frisk and/or search drivers, any passengers, and/or the vehicle itself, relative to the number of vehicle stops by police. </dd>

          <dt>Pretextual Stop</dt>
          <dd>A stop by law enforcement, often in the context of stopping a vehicle  for a traffic code violation, in order to perform a speculative criminal investigation unrelated to the traffic infraction. </dd>
          <dt>PSA</dt>
          <dd>Police Service Area of the Philadelphia Police Department, the smallest geographical subdivision of a police district to which police personnel are assigned.</dd>
          <dt>Search</dt>
          <dd>An examination of a person and/or their property or premises, which a person would reasonably consider private, by law enforcement with the intent of discovering evidence of the commission of a crime. Police must have probable cause to conduct a search. A search may legally be conducted upon arrest, upon issuance of a warrant, and in some exigent or emergency  circumstances. In this dashboard, any search of a driver, passenger, and/or vehicle during one traffic stop is calculated as a single search.</dd>
          <dt>Search Rate</dt>
          <dd>How often police search drivers, any passengers, and/or vehicles, relative to the number of vehicle stops by police. </dd>
          <dt>Traffic Stop </dt>
          <dd>When police stop a vehicle for a violation of the motor vehicle code.  A stop is any detention in which the person stopped is not immediately free to leave, such as when police pull over a vehicle for a known or suspected traffic violation.  </dd>
